#!/usr/bin/env python3

# You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s
# elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's
# elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
#
# The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to
# its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
# Output: [-1,3,-1]
# Explanation:
#     For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number
# for it in the second array, so output -1.
#     For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the
# second array is 3.
#     For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it
# in the second array, so output -1.

# Note:
# All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
# The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.
